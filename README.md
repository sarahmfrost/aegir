Wave Function Collapse for wine descriptions 


Forked this repo: https://github.com/mewo2/oisin 
Mashes up sentance fragments to produce poems with fixed metric forms. 

Example of output:

There was not a lot of documentation for installation, so we messed around with that for a while. 

Sarah's installation process: 
Download project and unzip

pip3 install 

python3 ballad.py 



We then replaced the input file with descriptions of wine.
