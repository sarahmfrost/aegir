**Wave Function Collapse for wine descriptions**

*This project is named for Ã†gir, the Norse god of beer and mead*


We Forked this repo: https://github.com/mewo2/oisin 
which mashes up sentance fragments to produce poems with fixed metric forms.

The original repository had minimal documentation for installation and running the algorithm, so we messed around with that for a while. 

The installation process running Mac OS: 

Download project and unzip
In your terminal, cd to the directory and run the following commands:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 ballad.py 
```

To change the output of ballad.py, an obvious first step is to change the corpus that is referenced. In our case, we tested this algorithm on a document filled with wine terminology definitions and drink descriptions that can be found in "input/wine.txt" and updated the filename reference in ballad.py. 

```
filename = "input/wine.txt"
```

Another way to adjust the output is to change the parameters called in the balladize() function in ballad.py. The balladize() function in defined in "oisin/poetry.py". This function takes in the following variables: tokens (or the corpus), meter (which is defined using the iambic() function), step size, refrain and order.

```
oisin.balladize(
    oisin.load(filename),
    meter=oisin.iambic(6, 'aabbcc'),
    step=13,
    order=3)
```

To add more variation to the output text, we randomized the step size between values of 1 to 12 in the balladize() function. Otherwise, running balladize() multiple times does not lead to varied results.
