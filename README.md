Wave Function Collapse for wine description 


Forked this repo: https://github.com/mewo2/oisin 
There was not a lot of documentation for installation, so we messed around with that for a while. 

Sarah's installation process: 
Download project and unzip

pip3 install 

python3 ballad.py 



We then replaced the input file with descriptions of wine.
